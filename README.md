**Car Sell Price Prediction**

This project is a machine learning application designed to estimate the resale price of a car based on various input features. It uses a linear regression model trained on historical car data and is deployed using Streamlit for interactive use.

**Features Used for Prediction:**
- *Year of Manufacture*
- *Present Price (in lakhs)*
- *Kilometers Driven*
- *Number of Previous Owners*
- *Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)*
- *Seller Type (Dealer, Individual)*
- *Transmission Type (Manual, Automatic)*

**Files Included:**
- \`app.py\` — Streamlit application script
- \`car_model.pkl\` — Trained machine learning model
- \`car_price_prediction.csv\` — Dataset used for training

**How to Run Locally:**
1. Install required packages:
   \`\`\`
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
   \`\`\`
2. Run the application:
   \`\`\`
   streamlit run app.py
   \`\`\`
